Description: A package designed to facilitate the metaclustering analysis described in Wiedeman et al., 
    2020, J Clin Invest. In brief, the approach defines phenotypic clusters from a parent population 
    (eg: all CD8+ cells in PBMC) and then maps rare cells (eg: antigen-specific memory cells) on the 
    parent population's phenotypic landscape to robustly characterize differences in the rare cells.
